# DDDGameGMS2
Migrating DoOrDieDragonite to GMS2, finally

The original GMS1 project can be found [here](https://github.com/DragoniteSpam/PokemonDoOrDie), but I probably won't be updating it a whole lot after this

**Currently doing work in a private repository, but when I'm done with that I'll update this one with the stuff I don't mind being public. The [editor](https://github.com/DragoniteSpam/DDDEditorGMS2) will remain public.
